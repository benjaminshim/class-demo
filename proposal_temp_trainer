###Idea: Running Training Planner

##Overall Summary:

My proposal for the project is a tool for adjusting a runners weekly training schedule according to the weather. Often times
the race one is training for may not reflect the weather that is avalible to train in. Heat and dew point has a influence 
on the effort it takes the typical person to run a given pace per mile. 

Say you are racing in december but begin training in July, it can be hard to recognize the weather change that will occur and
also consider that summer heat into ones training schedule. 

This tool will allow users to enter a Race date. The tool will create an adjusted estimated training pace to acheive that goal.
Then, they can also do a week input of training plan. The tool will take the plan and adjust all paces according to the
wheather report of temp and dew point for that week
